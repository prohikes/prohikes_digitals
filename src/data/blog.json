            "<div class='row sub-section-mb mt-7 mt-lg-0'><p class='pb-2'>The competition amongst remodelling companies has become more than ever as the home improvement industry continues to expand and change. In the United States, the industry as a whole is currently valued at over $400 billion, and by 2024, that amount is expected to rise to over $500 billion. Consumers spend an increasing amount of money remodelling their homes each year, which means the need for local home improvement businesses to distinguish themselves from the rest is, to say the least, crucial.</p></div>",

Will they find you, or one of your competitors?  Do a fast Google search for &quot;remodelers + one of the cities you service.&quot; or &quot;kitchen remodeling + one of the cities you service.&quot; What do you see? If you don’t have at least one listing on the first page of search results, you’re losing business!</p><p>The home improvement industry continues to grow.   In fact, searches on Google for phrases like “home remodel” or “kitchen remodel” have skyrocketed from 2020-2021.<p>However, there are also an increasing number of home improvement businesses trying for market share. <br>Home improvement advertising makes sure you receive your share as well.</p></p></div></div><div class='col-xl-5 col-md-6 text-center mt-7 mt-md-0 offset-xl-1'><img class='mt-xl-n3 ml-n2' src='/images/service/remodeling/4.png' alt='img' alt='service' /></div></div>",
            "<p class='pb-2'>Traditionally, home improvement marketing has meant relying on referrals. But relying solely on that will not fast-track your business to new levels of growth. With more and more companies investing in marketing strategies, it’s easy to get left in the dust. <br>So do you want to actually start growing your business instead of just getting by?  Then it's essential that you reevaluate your promotional strategies.</p>",
            "<div class='blog-qutation'><p>Home improvement marketing is an effective way to speed up and automate certain steps in your sales and marketing processes. In addition, home improvement PPC or pay-per-click uses precision targeting to reach ideal customers in accordance with crucial metrics such as location, homeowner status, interests, age, and household income. Building an optimised and conversion-focused website will help your business generate more leads.</p><i class='icofont-quote-right'></i></div>",
            "<p class='text-primary fw-semi-bold mb-6'> To put it frankly, you're losing out on a lot of prospective clients if your home improvement company doesn't invest in effective digital marketing methods. Instead of simply airing an ad through various means and hope a few leads may result from it, digital marketing enables firms to focus on marketing themselves to specific, targeted customers.</p>"

            "<div class='single-service-list'><h3 class='title1'>3. Collect and publish online reviews</h3><p> People trust online reviews more than personal recommendations by as much as 84%. And 87% of people claim that a company must have a rating of three to five stars before they will use them. <br>Basically… online reviews are the new word of mouth referrals. <br> Additionally, getting more positive reviews will raise your position in the natural search results. It will be difficult for people not to contact you if you are in the top Google results and have a good amount of 4 and 5-star reviews.<br>So how can you get all those great reviews? <p>Ask your customers to submit reviews on websites like Google My Business, Yelp, and Facebook (or all of them! ), in addition to performing outstanding work (that's a given).</p></p><p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i>Ask when your client is happiest </p><p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i>Don’t wait to ask—do it right after you finish the job </p> <p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i> Invite them to share any suggestions to help improve your service</p><p>Don’t be discouraged if you get a negative review.

            "<div class='single-service-list'><h3 class='title1'>4. List your business on industry lead sites</h3><p>Your business is already listed on Google My Business and social media, so. It's time to switch to other lead sites that are focused on the housing and construction sectors Start by creating profiles on the following sites.to gradually expand your internet presence.<br>Here are a few popular sites home improvement contractors should check out:</p><p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i>Houzz </p> <p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i> HomeAdvisor</p> <p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i> Angi</p><p><i class='fa fa-angle-double-right'></i> Thumbtack</p><p>Additionally, you might look locally for online contractor directories that you can join.

            "<div class='single-service-list'><h3 class='title1'><p>5. Share project images and videos on social media</h3><p>Social media isn’t just for fitness influencers and celebrities. It’s for home   improvement businesses too!<br> Take before and after photos or video tours as you work on your projects. This is a fantastic way to display your talent. Even posting small movies that highlight your unique construction techniques might be done throughout the project. <br> Important! - It's a good idea to get permission from the owners before before you post any pictures of their home.</p></div>",
            "<div class='single-service-list'><h3 class='title1'>6. Nurture leads with email campaigns</h3><p>People's decision of a contractor may take weeks or even months. You can remain in touch with prospective leads and turn them into clients with the help of email campaigns. <br>  The most effective approach to achieve this is to include an email signup form on your website and provide a perk for subscribing. It can be a discount on an upcoming project or a free newsletter or ebook with home improvement-related info. <br>  Don't bombard them with daily emails once you have their email. Reach out sometimes to build a relationship, share valuable information, and show how you can help solve their problems.</p>",
            "<div class='single-service-list'><h3 class='title1'>7. Launch a referral program</h3><p>The best salespeople are satisfied customers. Create a referral programme to further reward your satisfied consumers. <p> You don't need a sophisticated referral system. The majority of contractors only opt to provide a straightforward monetary incentive whenever someone refers a new client their way. Others offer a discount on a future project. You can offer both and let the customer decide. <br> Just make sure the prize is &quot;interesting enough&quot; to motivate people to actually take part.</p> <p> The nicest thing about this marketing strategy is how quick and easy it is to put into practise. Just invite them to post a review while also mentioning your referral programme. Even better, create a tiny card or brochure explaining the rewards you provide.</p></p></div"
